                                    The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became
                                    the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state. In 1920 the country was
                                    incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The
                                    modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, shortly
                                    before the dissolution of the USSR in the same year. In September 1991, the Armenian
                                    majority of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region seceded to form the Republic of
                                    Artsakh. The region and seven adjacent districts outside it became de facto
                                    independent with the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994. These regions are
                                    internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of
                                    the Nagorno-Karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE.

                                    Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential republic. It is one of six independent
                                    Turkic states and an active member of the Turkic Council and the TÜRKSOY community.
                                    Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and holds membership in 38
                                    international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1992), the Council
                                    of Europe, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OSCE, and the NATO Partnership for Peace
                                    (PfP) program. It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the Commonwealth of
                                    Independent States (CIS) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
                                    Weapons. Azerbaijan also holds observer status in the World Trade Organization.

                                    While more than 89% of the population is Shia Muslim, the Constitution of Azerbaijan
                                    does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country
                                    are secularist. Azerbaijan has a high level of human development according to the
                                    Human Development Index. It has a high rate of economic development and literacy, as
                                    well as a low rate of unemployment. However, the ruling party, the New Azerbaijan
                                    Party, has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses.
